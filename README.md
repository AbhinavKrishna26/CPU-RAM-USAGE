# CPU-RAM_USAGE

<h1 align="center">Weather Information Machine</h1>

### Made by ABHINAV KRISHNA

## Introduction

The Project features a working model of a CPU and RAM usage monitor of your computer. It shows the data in the LCD display and updates it in realtime. It comes in quite handy when doing CPU rigorous tasks where you need to monitor your PC's performance.

## Materials Required

- Hardware
	- Arduino NANO with Cable
	- 16x2 LCD Display Module
	- I2C Module
	- Breadboard
	- Jumper Wires
- Software
	- Arduino IDE

## Working of the Machine
The core parts of our project involve the `Arduino NANO` which serves as our microcontroller and executes our code, and finally the `LCD Display` which outputs the data onto the screen and we can then finally read the data.

## Making the required Connections
Once we have all the components required for this project, we then proceed further on making the connections. Here a schematic representation for the same.

## Coding our Project

Once we are done with the connections we then write the code for getting the data from the sensor and then eventually displaying it on the screen.

## Conclusion

We have our fully functional weather station. It has an OLED display for us to see the weather in a great manner.

We can make the design more compact and use a rechargeable battery for powering it. With the compact device, it would be convenient to carry it around if we place everything in a case. And we will be having our own *Pocket Weather Machine*.
